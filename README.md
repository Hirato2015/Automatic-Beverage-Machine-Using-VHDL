An automatic beverage machine uses a state machine concept, part of a sequential circuit showing a specific state at a given time. 
It's designed in VHDL and simulated with TINA software. 
It requires 5 states and 6 sensor inputs for operation, represented by adjustable input buttons and distinct LED-lit states.
